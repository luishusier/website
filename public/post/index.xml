      <description>There has been an ongoing discussion on Twitter on whether it is better for underdogs to play defensively or offensively.
Werder Bremen is ill advised to focus on defense. In relegation race you need to focus on scoring. The old 4:3-Werder would do better.
&amp;mdash; Goalimpact (@Goalimpact) September 27, 2017  Now, to me, it is a mathematical certainty that lower-scoring games are more random, and thus better for the underdog.</description>
