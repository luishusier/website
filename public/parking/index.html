<p>Now, to me, it is a mathematical certainty that lower-scoring games are more random, and thus better for the underdog. Conversely, higher-scoring games are better for the favorites, who are more assured of winning.</p>
<p>It is a pretty simple point, and it squares with the general perceptions people have about the football. Relegation-threatened teams are frequently celebrated for “parking the bus”, or criticized for not doing it. Most people who watch football would intuitively agree with this point.</p>
<p>Most, but not all.</p>
<p>As every other claim made about football, this one also draws its fair share of resistance and pushback. Many people are interested in answering this question, but not everyone has the necessary mathematical background to do it. Inevitably, they end up going down the wrong path.</p>
<p>So I decided to show, using real data, how it is better for relegation contenders to be defensive and for title contenders to be attacking. I hope this empirical exercise will convince people to accept the mathematics behind the question, even if they can’t necessarily understand them.</p>
<p>Our dataset contains 15 Premier League seasons, with points and goals.</p>

<p>The goal is to model total points as a function of the goals scored and conceded. First we have to re-parameterize goals scored/conceded to an unconstrained scale, as we are going to use them in a linear model later. Count data such as goals is lower-bounded at zero, but there should be no limit to how bad a team’s attack is. We then calculate a measure of quality and a measure of attacking/defensive balance.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>premier_league_historical_stats &lt;- 
  premier_league_historical_stats %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    
    # First, see how many goals the team scores relative to the average
    norm_attack = goals_for %&gt;% divide_by(mean(goals_for)) %&gt;% 
      # Then, transform it into an unconstrained scale
      log(),
    # First, see how many goals the team concedes relative to the average
    norm_defense = goals_against %&gt;% divide_by(mean(goals_against)) %&gt;% 
      # Invert it, so a higher defense is better
      raise_to_power(-1) %&gt;% 
      # Then, transform it into an unconstrained scale
      log(),
    
    # Now that we have normalized attack and defense ratings, we can compute
    # measures of quality and attacking balance
    
    quality = norm_attack + norm_defense,
    balance = norm_attack - norm_defense
  )</code></pre>
<p>We now have two metrics, <code>quality</code> and <code>balance</code>, that capture how good and how attacking a team is, respectively. Incidentally, <code>quality</code> is exactly the log of the goal ratio, a metric that is familiar to football fans. <code>balance</code> is it’s lesser-kown sibling, that we can christen as <em>goal product</em> as it should map directly onto the product of the goals scored and the goals conceded.</p>
<p>These are the most attacking teams in the past 15 seasons:</p>

<p>Now we can fit a simple linear model of points, where the predictors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality: the greater the quality, the higher the total points</li>
<li>Interaction between quality and balance: according to our “hypothesis”, for high-quality teams, an attacking balance should lead to more points. For low-quality teams, the reverse should be true.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve shown the p-values above, in case you care about them (which you shouldn’t, but horses for courses, etc).</p>
<p>So we would expect a team of average quality and average balance to get about 52 points over a season. The team quality obviously has a huge impact on the team’s point return.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we see that the interaction term <code>quality:balance</code> is positive, meaning when both quality and balance are positive (i.e. attacking title contenders) a team will get more points and that when both are negative (i.e. defensive relegation battlers) it will also get more points.</p>
<p>This hopefully should prove our hypothesis. However, just to make sure, let’s look at it from a different angle. Let’s fit one model to attacking teams and another to defensive teams and see how they differ. We are expecting attacking teams’ points totals to display a stronger dependence on the team quality. In other words, defensive teams tend towards an average points return, whereas attacking teams tend towards an extreme (good or bad) points return.</p>
<p>Results in plot form:</p>

<p>As we can see, the red line, fit on the attacking teams, has a bigger slope than the blue line. The red dots are higher than the blue dots at high quality, but lower at low quality.</p>
<p><strong>For good teams, it is better to be offensive, and for bad teams, it is better to be defensive</strong></p>
